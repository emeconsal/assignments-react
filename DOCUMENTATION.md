# ‚åö Time Estimation

I estimated around 3-4 hours for completing the whole task; I ended up spending around 4-5h in total. I had some fights with my package manager to install the Storybook addon, and [spent 30 mins](https://github.com/emeconsal/assignments-react/commit/77a3c1d958970754cd5acbe8d408289a2f0bd8d1) trying to implement a cleaner approach for hooks using only TanStack Query (without `useStates` or `useEffects`).

I started on Tuesday, July 16th, at 6 PM, finished around 8 PM, and then continued on Wednesday, July 17th, at approximately 4 PM until 6 PM. (First commits were fast because I started coding on the main repo - rookie mistake üòÖ).

The styling part was very short, around 1 hour maximum if I count all the different tasks that I kept doing intermittently.

The biggest challenges were implementing the hooks for fetching, updating, and removing data and, surprisingly, debugging my pnpm to install the Storybook addon.

# üß† Reasoning behind technologies and architecture

### TanStack Query

In general, it's a great tool to work with APIs as it already contains built-in caching, revalidation, and it can be highly configurable if needed (I used a basic setup with `useQuery` and `useMutation` for simplicity).

Whenever any mutation is done (delete, update, create item), the cache is revalidated (only [onSuccess](client/src/hooks/useCreateItem.ts#23)).

### Storybook Addon: storybook-addon-pseudo-states

It's the [recommended library and approach to use](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-pseudo-states) when forcing pseudo-states according to the official documentation. I imagine there are ways to do it natively, but I don't have much experience with Storybook.
